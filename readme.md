## Introduction
---------------

     "Anyone who believes that exponential growth can continue indefinitely in a finite world is either a fool or an economist." 
      - Kenneth Ewart Boulding

     "The right of every life form to live is a universal right that cannot be quantified. No living species has more of this particular right to live and expand than any other species."

     "Science without conscience is but the ruin of the soul."
      - Fran√ßois Rabelais

     "Primum non nocere", "First do no harm"
      - Hippocrates, ca. 410 B.C.

## Deep Ecology
---------------

The proponents of deep ecology believe that the world is not a resource to be exploited at will by humans. The deep ecology ethic explains that a global system (nature) is superior to each of its parts (man being a part of nature). This ethic is based on the following eight postulates:

The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human life forms on Earth have value in themselves (synonym: intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the utility of the nonhuman world for human needs.
The richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.
Humans have no right to reduce biological richness and diversity, except to satisfy vital human needs.
The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease in human population. The development of non-human life forms requires such a decrease.
Current human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive and harmful, and the situation is rapidly worsening.
Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect fundamental economic, technological, and ideological structures. The result will be a society profoundly different from our own.
The ideological changes involve the appreciation of a good quality of life rather than the adherence to ever higher standards of living. We must be aware of the difference between "good quality of life" and the "race to an extremely high standard of living" (which would be harmful to nature).
Those who agree with the above points commit themselves to try to implement the necessary changes directly or indirectly.
## Manifesto for a science at the service of ALL life forms:
------------------------------------------------------------

The state of scientific research of human civilizations reflects with great fidelity its social behaviors, the quality of its ways of life -health of individuals-, what is produced from it, and the future of its products.

Human knowledge should be put at the service of the living, not of money.

Science should be used exclusively to improve the living conditions of ALL living beings, through a strict ethical code.

We must compile all the eco-compatible scientific knowledge acquired so far, and put it in a safe place for future generations, on sustainable supports (also eco-compatible in the long term, via a research effort).

It is a question of initiating a major shift in knowledge and behavior, while improving the quality of life, always with a constant concern for harmonious compatibility with the living, even when recourse is made to advanced sciences and/or technologies.

The latter must ALWAYS and IMPERATIVELY be subjected to rigorous ecotoxicological validation, and/or energy audit, and/or life cycle analysis.
